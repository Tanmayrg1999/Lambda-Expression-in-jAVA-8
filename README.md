# Lambda-Expression-in-jAVA-8
A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.Lambda expression is a new and important feature of Java which was included in Java SE 8. It provides a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. It is very useful in collection library. It helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.
The Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface. It saves a lot of code. In case of lambda expression, we don't need to define the method again for providing the implementation. Here, we just write the implementation code.


## PROBLEM
Write a java application to create calculator by using Lambda expression. Here you need to do the following:

Create interface CalculatorFace with a member function

public int calculate(int operand1,int operand2, String operator);

Create a class Main with methods

a) Public int performCalculation(int operand1, int operand2,String operator, CalculatorFace calculator);

b) Public static void main(String arg[])

Accept input, use lamda expression then display result
